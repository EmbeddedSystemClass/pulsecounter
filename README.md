# pulsecounter

Arduino smart meter pulse counter sensor

You can read about this project in a my series of post about it: [Smart Meter Pulse Counter ](http://tinkerman.eldiariblau.net/smartmeter-pulse-counter-4/ "Smart Meter Pulse Counter").

## Requirements

The code has been tested with an Arduino Pro Mini but it should work on any Atmel uC with Arduino bootloader.
The XBee configuration file is in the *xbee* folder. It is an END DEVICE AT firmware with a cyclic sleep of 20x3 seconds.
